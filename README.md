# Svelte Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Svelte project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Svelte, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), deployed with Vercel, you can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
```
